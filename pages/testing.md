<br>Founded in 2010, the creation of the Robotics Institute @ Guelph was motivated by the growing need to foster common interest partnerships among faculty members, students, and industry partners interested in non-traditional robotics research. This research focuses on robots that operate in close proximity to people, and in environments which are typically cluttered, unstructured and therefore involve higher degrees of uncertainty. As such, this requires understanding how people and robots can work together in a safe and effective manner, as well as examining how robots can learn and therefore adapt to changes in their environment.
